#Flood Prediction Web Application
##Overview
This application uses a trained CatBoost model to predict flood probabilities based on input features. The application is developed using Flask and can be run locally on your machine. This README file provides instructions on how to run the executable file generated from the source code.

##Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine
Required Python libraries (Flask, CatBoost, Pandas, etc.)

The executable file generated by PyInstaller
Running the Application
Download the Executable

Download the executable file from the dist directory (e.g., app.exe for Windows or app for Linux/Mac) to your local machine.

Run the Executable

Windows: Double-click the app.exe file to run the application. Alternatively, you can run it from the command prompt:


path\to\app.exe
Linux/Mac: Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the executable, and run:
./app
Access the Application

Once the application is running, open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the web interface.

Using the Web Interface

Fill in the form with the required input features for flood prediction.
Click the "Submit" button to get the predicted flood probability.
Troubleshooting
Executable Not Found: Ensure that the executable file is located in the correct directory and that it has executable permissions (Linux/Mac).

Dependency Issues: If the application fails to run due to missing dependencies, ensure that all required Python libraries are included in the build. You may need to adjust the PyInstaller settings or install the dependencies manually.

Model Loading Errors: If the application cannot load the trained model, ensure that the models/cb_submission.pkl file is present in the same directory as the executable.
